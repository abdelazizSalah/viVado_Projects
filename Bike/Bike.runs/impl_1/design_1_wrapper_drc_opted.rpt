REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 design_1_i/BIKE_0/inst/BRAM_SK/I0_BRAM.BRAM_SK/BRAM/RAMB36E1_inst has an input control pin design_1_i/BIKE_0/inst/BRAM_SK/I0_BRAM.BRAM_SK/BRAM/RAMB36E1_inst/ADDRARDADDR[11] (net: design_1_i/BIKE_0/inst/BRAM_SK/I0_BRAM.BRAM_SK/BRAM/ADDRARDADDR[6]) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/sk0_memory_0/inst/counter_reg_rep[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
